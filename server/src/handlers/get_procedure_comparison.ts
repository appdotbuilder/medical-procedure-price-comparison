    // 2. Get all pricing entries for this procedure with associated practice information
    // 3. Calculate which pricing option has the lowest cost
    // 4. Mark the lowest price entries with is_lowest_price: true

    // 6. Use db.select() with joins between procedurePricingTable, medicalPracticesTable, and medicalProceduresTable
    // 7. Return null if procedure not found
